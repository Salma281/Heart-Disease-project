Welcome to Heart Disease project 


# Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.
It involves **data preprocessing, feature engineering, supervised/unsupervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment** with a **Streamlit web app**.

# Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salma281/Heart-Disease-project.git
cd Heart-Disease-project
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Running the Project (notebook by notebook)

# 1. Jupyter Notebooks
Each notebook in `notebooks/` covers a project requirement:
from 2.1 : 2.7

 Data preprocessing & cleaning
 PCA (dimensionality reduction)
 Feature selection
 Supervised learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
 Unsupervised learning (K-Means, Hierarchical)
 Hyperparameter tuning

Run them in order to reproduce results.

Each notebook will create new .csv file in order to:
1) be reused across notebooks
    (To have tthe ability of taking one step back incase needed)
2) Keep the original dataset untouched
    (to avoid any risk of loosing the raw data)

# 2. Run the Streamlit Web App
Steps to Run the App:
1) Open integrated terminal from Ui folder
2) paste : streamlit run app.py

This will open the link(`http://localhost:8501`).
Enter patient data then get predection.



# Features Considered for each patient
